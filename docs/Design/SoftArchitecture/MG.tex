\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific
  hardware on which the software is running.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format of the
  initial input data.
\item ...
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices
  (Input: File and/or Keyboard, Output: File, Memory, and/or Screen).
\item ...
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

\subsection{User Profile Management Module} \label{SecMD}

The SweatSmart application is composed of several distinct modules, each responsible for a separate concern within the system. This modular approach ensures that each part of the application can be developed, tested, and maintained in isolation, promoting a scalable and robust software architecture.

The following sections detail the specific responsibilities and design of each module, providing insight into their individual functions as well as their interactions with other parts of the system. The decomposition is designed to encapsulate core functionalities and to define clear boundaries and interfaces for interaction, facilitating a plug-and-play architecture that can evolve as new features and requirements emerge.

Each module is described with an emphasis on its ``secret'' – the design and knowledge it hides from other modules, its interface – the access points for other parts of the system to interact with it, and its interaction with other modules, which delineates how it cooperates within the system to deliver cohesive functionality. 

The primary modules identified for the SweatSmart application are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item User Profile Module
    \item Workout Generation Module
    \item Data Management Module
    \item User Interaction Module
    \item Reporting and Feedback Module
    \item Algorithm Selection Module
    \item Input Format Module
\end{itemize}

In subsequent sections, we will delve into the particulars of each module, starting with the User Profile Module.

\subsection{Behaviour-Hiding Module}

\subsection{User Profile Management Module (M1)}

The User Profile Management Module is central to the personalization features of the SweatSmart application. Its primary responsibility is to manage user-specific data, which includes account creation, user authentication, and the storage and retrieval of personal fitness profiles.

\begin{description}
    \item[Secrets:] The module encapsulates the logic for user data validation, ensuring that data integrity is maintained and personal information is stored securely. It also handles the encryption and decryption of sensitive information to protect user privacy. Additionally, this module will include logic to provide data in the format expected by the Algorithm Selection Module for personalized workout algorithms.
    \item[Services:]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Account creation and management.
        \item User login and authentication processes.
        \item Personal information updates and management.
        \item Privacy settings and account security features.
        \item Services for formatting user data as per the standards defined in the Input Format Module.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[Interfaces:]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An API endpoint for account creation and modification.
        \item Authentication services that integrate with third-party identity providers.
        \item Interfaces for other system modules to retrieve or update user profiles.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[Interaction with Other Modules:] This module interacts closely with the Workout Generation Module to provide personalized workout plans based on the user's fitness profile. It also communicates with the Data Management Module to persist user information and with the Reporting and Feedback Module to adjust user preferences based on feedback.
\end{description}

By maintaining a clear separation of concerns, the User Profile Management Module ensures that user-related features are modular, scalable, and independent, enabling effective and secure management of user-specific data within the broader SweatSmart system. This module's design will provide potential for future enhancements such as integration with social media platforms for enriched user profiles and community engagement.


\subsubsection{Input Format Module (\mref{mInput})}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The format and structure of the input data.
\item[Services:]Converts the input data into the data structure used by the
  input parameters module.
\item[Implemented By:] [Your Program Name Here]
\item[Type of Module:] [Record, Library, Abstract Object, or Abstract Data Type]
  [Information to include for leaf modules in the decomposition by secrets tree.]
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Etc.}


\subsection{Software Decision Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:] The design decision based on mathematical theorems, physical
  facts, or programming considerations. The secrets of this module are
  \emph{not} described in the SRS.
\item[Services:] Includes data structure and algorithms used in the system that
  do not provide direct interaction with the user. 
  % Changes in these modules are more likely to be motivated by a desire to
  % improve performance than by externally imposed changes.
\item[Implemented By:] --

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.
